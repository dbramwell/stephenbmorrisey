      description: "Barely two weeks after the tragic death of his wife in a burglary gone wrong, Jack Kelly is given a message to take to the recently disgraced UK Foreign Secretary, David Floxly. The message reads: 'Tell Floxly that Russia's President Vladimir Bunin has just gone AWOL from Moscow and that he is travelling to England with a casket of dirty Uranium.' A deep secret from the Cold War is about to set off a train of events which can change Russia and the world for ever. Can Jack Kelly, an ex-banker who worked in Moscow during the wild years after the fall of Communism, discover what is really about to happen? Can he find the strength in his desperate state to prevent it? Or will London be changed beyond recognition and, with it, the world as we know it?"
